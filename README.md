# HTML-CSS
Documenting my journey into JavaScript and HTML w/ CSS

---

To begin a rudimentary "webpage" a simple ```.html``` file is necessary. Once the file has been created, it can be accessed locally in your web browser.

The only things necessary for the file to work are:
* doctype html call in the first line
```
<!doctype html>
```

* html tags

```
<html>
text
</html>
```

That's it! Check out the ```basic_html.html``` file here: https://github.com/MethaneRain/JavaScript/blob/master/basic_html.html
