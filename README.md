# HTML-CSS
Documenting my journey into HTML w/ CSS

---

HTML is mainly used for static web content and provides the actual web content.

JavaScript differs as it is the dynamic environment to handle dynamic events on web pages.

To begin a rudimentary "webpage" a simple ```.html``` file is necessary. Once the file has been created, it can be accessed locally in your web browser.

The only things necessary for the file to work are:
* doctype html call in the first line
```
<!doctype html>
```

* html tags

```
<html>
text
</html>
```

That's it! Check out the ```basic_html.html``` file here: https://github.com/MethaneRain/JavaScript/blob/master/basic_html.html

CSS (cascade style sheet) is what gives the html file some really cool options for formatting, font, and a whole bunch of other styling for the content. This is what makes some webpages look really professional. Since I'm still learning I've been able to get a basic idea of how to integrate this into the ```html``` file.

The ```.css``` file is added into the different ```<div>``` tags in the ```html``` file.
